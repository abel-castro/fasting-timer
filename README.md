# Fasting Timer

![Fasting Timer 18:6](https://github.com/abel-castro/fasting-timer/blob/main/fasting-timer-screenshot.jpg)

A timer for tracking 18:6 fasting periods.

The goal of this project wasnâ€™t to focus what the timer cad do, but rather to learn how to work with React/Next.js applications and write tests for them.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
